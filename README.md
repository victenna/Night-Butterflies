# Night-Butterflies
Python Pygame mini-project for school kids. We present butterflies motion in the presence of a lit light. 
The appearance of light at any point on the screen attracts butterflies and they rush to this area and fly 
near the lit light. In our scenario position of the light bulb on the screen is controlled by pressing the 
left mouse button while placing the mouse arrow at the corresponding point. If we want to turn off the light 
bulb, press the space bar. The logic of the butterflies motion is written taking into account the direction 
of movement, i.e. the head of each butterfly is oriented in the direction of movement. Files for modeling of 
this scenario can be downloaded free of charge at:
