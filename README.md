# Night-Butterflies
Python Pygame mini-project for school kids. Animation scenario:  behavior  of night butterflies  
in the presence of a lit light. Assume that night   butterflies fly evenly across the night screen.
The appearance of light at any point on the screen attracts butterflies and they rush to this area 
and fly near the lit light. In our scenario position of the light bulb on the screen is controlled by
pressing the left mouse button while placing the mouse arrow at the corresponding point. If we want to
turn off the light bulb, press the space bar. Python code is created such a way that  the head of each
butterfly is oriented in the direction of movement. Files for modeling of this scenario can be
downloaded free of charge at:
